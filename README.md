## Project Title: FastLane Cinemas

## About this Project

FASTLANE Cinemas has 3 different cinemas across Nigeria, each cinema has its respective showtimes for each movie available. 
I used Laravel to build a minimalistic application showing the list of movies with different showtimes in each cinema and provision for adding them from a user authenticated page. 
My code reflects the following:

- Use of repository pattern as an additional layer between the model and the controller

- Use the Eloquent ORM relationships for the entities.

- Use of Ajax(jQuery) for ALL HTTP requests (API-based).
